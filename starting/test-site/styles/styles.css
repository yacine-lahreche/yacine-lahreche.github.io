/*!* The whole structure (('  p { color: red; }  ')) is called a ruleset. Note the names of the individual parts:*/

/*Selector:*/
/*This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. It defines the element(s) to be styled (in this example, <p> elements).*/

/*Declaration:*/
/*This is a single rule like color: red;. It specifies which of the element's properties you want to style.*/

/*Properties:*/
/*These are ways in which you can style an HTML element. In CSS, you choose which properties you want to affect in the rule.*/

/*Property value:*/
/*To the right of the property—after the colon—there is the property value. This chooses one out of many possible appearances for a given property.*/
/*(For example, there are many color values in addition to red.)*/

/*Note the other important parts of the syntax:*/
/*Apart from the selector, each ruleset must be wrapped in curly braces. ({})*/
/*Within each declaration, you must use a colon (:) to separate the property from its value or values.*/
/*Within each ruleset, you must use a semicolon (;) to separate each declaration from the next one.*/

/*You can also select multiple elements and apply a single ruleset to all of them. Separate multiple selectors by commas (,). *!*/
