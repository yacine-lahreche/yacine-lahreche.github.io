<p>Linux is an open-source, Unix-like operating system kernel
    thatâ€™s been developed by a large community of contributors
    since its inception in 1991 by Linus Torvalds. Over the years,
    Linux has grown beyond just a kernel, evolving into complete operating systems
    (known as "distributions" or "distros") by bundling the kernel with
    various software packages and utilities.</p>
